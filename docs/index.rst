METS Reader & Writer
====================

By Artefactual_

METSRW is a library to help with parsing and creating METS files.
It provides an API, and abstracts away the actual creation of the XML.
METSRW was initially created for use in Archivematica_ and is managed as part
of that project.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute metsrw with attribution under the
