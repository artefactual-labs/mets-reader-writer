## Contribution standards

For more information on contribution guidelines and standards, see the
CONTRIBUTING.md in the [Archivematica project](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica).

## Contributor's Agreement

In order for the Archivematica development team to accept any patches or code
commits, contributors must first sign this [Contributor's Agreement](https://wiki.archivematica.org/images/e/e6/Archivematica-CLA-firstname-lastname-YYYY.pdf).
The Archivematica contributor's agreement is based almost verbatim on the
[Apache Foundation](http://apache.org )'s individual [contributor license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).

If you have any questions or concerns about the Contributor's Agreement, please
email us at <agreement@artefactual.com> to discuss them.

### Why do I have to sign a Contributor's Agreement?

One of the key challenges for open source software is to support a collaborative
development environment while protecting the rights of contributors and users
over the long-term.
Unifying Archivematica copyrights through contributor agreements is the best way
to protect the availability and sustainability of Archivematica over the
long-term as free and open-source software.
In all cases, contributors who sign the Contributor's Agreement retain full
rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose outside of
Archivematica, while enabling Artefactual Systems, any successor organization
which may eventually take over responsibility for Archivematica, and the wider
Archivematica community to benefit from their collaboration and contributions in
this open source project.

[Artefactual Systems](http://artefactual.com) has made the decision and has a
proven track record of making our intellectual property available to the
community at large.
By standardizing contributions on these agreements the Archivematica
intellectual property position does not become too complicated.
This ensures our resources are devoted to making our project the best they can
be, rather than fighting legal battles over contributions.

### How do I send in an agreement?

Please print out, read, sign, and scan the [contributor agreement](https://wiki.archivematica.org/images/e/e6/Archivematica-CLA-firstname-lastname-YYYY.pdf)
and email it to <agreement@artefactual.com>
Alternatively, you may send an original signed agreement to:

    Artefactual Systems Inc.
    201 - 301 Sixth Street
    New Westminster BC  V3L 3A7
    Canada
